## Text Classification Using Naive Bayes and Sentiment Analysis on Blog Posts using TextBlob

### Overview
This project focuses on building a text classification model using the Naive Bayes algorithm and performing sentiment analysis on the "blogs_categories.csv" dataset. The dataset consists of blog posts categorized into various themes, and the objective is to classify these posts accurately and analyze their sentiments. This assignment will enhance your skills in text classification, sentiment analysis, and the practical application of Naive Bayes in Natural Language Processing (NLP).

### Dataset
- Filename: blogs_categories.csv
- Description: This dataset includes blog posts along with their associated categories. Each row contains:
- Text: The content of the blog post (Column name: Data).
- Category: The category to which the blog post belongs (Column name: Labels).

### 1. Data Exploration and Preprocessing
#### Data Exploration:
- Load the blogs_categories.csv dataset and perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand its structure, key statistics, and content.
- Examine the distribution of blog posts across different categories.
#### Data Cleaning and Preparation:
- Clean the text data by removing punctuation, converting text to lowercase, and addressing any inconsistencies.
- Tokenize the text and remove stopwords to focus on meaningful words.
- Perform feature extraction using techniques such as TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) to convert text into a numerical format suitable for model training.

### 2. Naive Bayes Model for Text Classification
#### Data Splitting:
- Split the dataset into training and testing sets to evaluate model performance effectively.
#### Model Implementation:
- Implement a Naive Bayes classifier using libraries such as scikit-learn.
- Train the model on the training data and make predictions on the test set.
#### Model Evaluation:
- Assess the classifierâ€™s performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

### 3. Sentiment Analysis
#### Sentiment Analysis using TextBlob:
- Choose a suitable library or method (e.g., TextBlob, VADER) to perform sentiment analysis on the blog post texts.
- Analyze the sentiment of each blog post and categorize them as positive, negative, or neutral based on the text content.
#### Sentiment Distribution:
- Examine the distribution of sentiments across different categories of blog posts.
- Summarize findings and discuss any trends or patterns observed.

### 4. Evaluation
#### Model Performance:
- Evaluate the Naive Bayes classifier using performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- Discuss the model's performance, including any challenges or limitations encountered during the classification process.
#### Sentiment Analysis Reflection:
- Reflect on the sentiment analysis results and their implications for understanding the content and emotional tone of the blog posts.
- Compare the sentiment findings with the classification results and discuss any insights or discrepancies.
